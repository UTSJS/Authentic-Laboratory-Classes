Authentic Laboratory Protocol for the First year Undergraduate Students</b></div><div>M H Islam and Jurgen Schulte; School of Mathematical and
Physical Sciences, University of Technology Sydney, Australia</div><div></div><div><b>Abstract:</b></div><div><b>&nbsp;</b>....</div><div></div><div><b>Introduction:</b></div><div>Authentic learning is a
pedagogical approach that allows students to explore, discuss, and meaningfully
construct concepts and relationships in contexts that involve real-world
problems and projects that are relevant to the learners (1). In an authentic
learning program,  opportunities are provided for the students to construct
their own knowledge through engaging in self-directed enquiry, problem solving,
critical thinking, team work and reflections in the context of a real-world problem solving task. On the basis of their prior knowledge and experiences, new  ideas
are developed and put into practice. Inherently, authentic learning is  student-centered and students apply their experiences and
knowledge in ways that are grounded in real world scenarios (2, 3). &nbsp;An authentic learning experience is expected &nbsp;to develop a realistic link between &nbsp; learned &nbsp;disciplinary material and desired expectations by future employers, customers, clients
and colleagues who will have the greatest stake in their success. &nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Authentic learning
environments are inherently multidisciplinary. In-depth disciplinary knowledge and skills are an employer's default expectation<b>&nbsp;</b>of a graduate student. in addition to these default skills, employers more commonly (ref) expect graduates to present some lateral knowledge across disciplines, skills that relate knowledge to social or economic context as well as some people and process management skills. These often referred to non-core disciplinary skills become more important as many graduates need to find work in areas that are peripheral to their degree course education, or the landscape of the relevant profession has changed rapidly during cause of the degree.</div><div></div><div>A key fThe educator providing a
supportive role, promoting students discussion and providing guidance rather
than directing the activity (4, 5). On the other hand in a traditional classroom,
the students take a passive role in the learning process. The learning is
considered to be a collection of fact and procedures that are transmitted from
the teacher to the student (6). The students follow step-by-step instructions
to perform the experiment, data collection and present the results according to
the set procedure. The students have little opportunities in self-directed
inquiry, critical thinking, designing experiment, problem solving and connect
their knowledge to the real word application (7).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Jean Lave and
Etienne Wenger argued that all engineers, scientists, mathematicians and
historians need to be “enculturated” into discipline and the earlier the better
(8). The student should know what actual stakeholders are beyond their classroom
to hold them accomplishing for their work products. The evaluation of the
projects coming from several sources including peers, supervisions and clients.
The goal of the authentic learning is to give learners the confidence that
comes with being recognized as ‘legitimate Peripheral Participants” in a
community of practice (9).</div><div>In 2004,
Renzulli, Gentry, and Reis (10) identified the following four
characteristics of authentic learning through the investigation of real-life
problems. First, the students will investigate a real-life problem that
involves an emotional commitment within the student with an interest. Second,
the problem needed to be open-ended without prescribed instructions for its
solution. Third, Students motivated to device solutions that change people’s
action, belief or attitudes. Finally, the problems targeted the real audience
or consumers beyond the classroom.</div><div>Real world
connections to learning are important because authentic pedagogy of both
instruction and assessment tasks is a strong predictor of student achievement
(11).</div><div>Fred M Newmann
and Gary G. Wehlage (1990) have suggested five standards of Authentic
Instruction such as higher order thinking, Depth of knowledge, Connectedness to the word beyond the classroom, Substantive conservation
and Social Support for student achievement (12). They measured the degree of
each authenticity by using a scale 1 – 5. For example low number 1 -2 indicates
lower order thinking and the higher numbers 3 – 5 indicates higher order
thinking. Similarly, the students  shallow knowledge indicated by the scale 1 and scale 5 indicate deep knowledge. The contentedness of the students beyond the class room indicated by scale 5 and the scale 1 indicated no connection.</div><div>Beck et al.
(2014; Brownell et al. (2012) and Malau-Aduli et al. (2012) have investigated
the benefit of inquiry based laboratories in biology curriculum in higher
education and their findings suggest that the students developed deeper
understanding in scientific content, increase confidence level in understanding
and improved students attitude towards science&nbsp;compared to traditional
laboratory teaching (13-15).</div><div>Bennett et al.
(2001) implemented authentic learning in two groups of student in multimedia
design in an advanced level subject with small project team and worked with a
real client to develop an interactive multimedia package (16). The students formed small project teams and worked with a real client to develop an interactive multimedia package. They found<b>&nbsp;</b>that this kind of learning program help student in problem solving,
critical thinking and judgement needed to work with complex multifaceted design
problems (16). S kinner and Cowan (1995) also investigated open-ended practical
learning method as part of their science education and have found that the
students developed good level of conceptual understanding and development of
process skill even for the poorest student (17). The authentic learning is therefore provides a means by which the students can link their theories and concept from the formal education to the workplace practice.</div><div>&nbsp;In the present paper, we have reported the
benefit of the implemented authentic laboratory education in the first year
undergraduate course at the University of Technology, Sydney, Australia.
We also have presented a design idea of an authentic learning observational
protocol for first year undergraduate laboratory program. In our laboratory education system we have introduced four different types of laboratory education such as traditional, theoretical type laboratory, semi-authentic and authentic experiment (project based experiment) to compare the benefit of the authentic learning over the other type of laboratory education system.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>Methodology:</b></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>References:</b></div><div>1.
