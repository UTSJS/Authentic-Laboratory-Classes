Authentic Laboratory Protocol for the First year Undergraduate Students</b></div><div>M H Islam and Jurgen Schulte; School of Mathematical and
Physical Sciences, University of Technology Sydney, Australia</div><div></div><div><b>Abstract:</b></div><div><b>&nbsp;</b>....</div><div></div><div><b>Introduction:</b></div><div>Authentic learning is a
pedagogical approach that allows students to explore, discuss, and meaningfully
construct concepts and relationships in contexts that involve real-world
problems and projects that are relevant to the learners (1). In an authentic
learning program,  opportunities are provided for the students to construct
their own knowledge through engaging in self-directed enquiry, problem solving,
critical thinking, team work and reflections in the context of a real-world problem solving task. On the basis of their prior knowledge and experiences, new  ideas
are developed and put into practice. Inherently, authentic learning is  student-centered and students apply their experiences and
knowledge in ways that are grounded in real world scenarios (2, 3). &nbsp;An authentic learning experience is expected &nbsp;to develop a realistic link between &nbsp; learned &nbsp;disciplinary material and desired expectations by future employers, customers, clients
and colleagues who will have the greatest stake in their success. &nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Authentic learning
environments are inherently multidisciplinary. In-depth disciplinary knowledge and skills are an employer's default expectation<b>&nbsp;</b>of a graduate student. in addition to these default skills, employers more commonly (ref) expect graduates to present some lateral knowledge across disciplines, skills that relate knowledge to social or economic context as well as some people and process management skills. These often referred to non-core disciplinary skills become more important as many graduates need to find work in areas that are peripheral to their degree course education, or the landscape of the relevant profession has changed rapidly during cause of the degree.</div><div></div><div>A key feature of an authentic learning approach is the educator taking on a
supportive role, promoting students discussion and providing guidance rather
than directing the activity (4, 5). On the other hand in a traditional classroom,
the students take a passive role in the learning process where learning is
considered to be a collection of facts and procedures that are transmitted from
the teacher to the student (6). The students follow step-by-step instructions
to perform the experiment, data collection and present the results according to
the set procedure. The students have little opportunities in self-directed
inquiry, critical thinking, designing experiment, problem solving and connect
their knowledge to the real word application (7). The student should know what actual stakeholders are beyond their classroom
to hold them accomplishing for their work products. The evaluation of the
projects comes from several sources including peers, supervisions and clients.
The goal of the authentic learning is to give learners the confidence that
comes with being recognized as ‘legitimate Peripheral Participants” in a
community of practice (8).</div><div>Maina (2004) indicated that authentic learning which target a real world problem have an impact on people outside of the students involved in the investigation (9). Real-world connections to the learner i</div><div>In 2004,
Renzulli, Gentry, and Reis (10) identified the following four
characteristics of authentic learning through the investigation of real-life
problems. First, the students will investigate a real-life problem that
involves an emotional commitment within the student with an interest. Second,
the problem needed to be open-ended without prescribed instructions for its
solution. Third, Students motivated to device solutions that change people’s
action, belief or attitudes. Finally, the problems targeted the real audience
or consumers beyond the classroom.</div><div>Real world
connections to learning are important because authentic pedagogy of both
instruction and assessment tasks is a strong predictor of student achievement
(11).</div><div>Fred M Newmann
and Gary G. Wehlage (1990) have suggested five standards of Authentic
Instruction such as higher order thinking, Depth of knowledge, Connectedness to the word beyond the classroom, Substantive conservation
and Social Support for student achievement (12). They measured the degree of
each authenticity by using a scale 1 – 5. For example low number 1 -2 indicates
lower order thinking and the higher numbers 3 – 5 indicates higher order
thinking. Similarly, the students  shallow knowledge indicated by the scale 1 and scale 5 indicate deep knowledge. The contentedness of the students beyond the class room indicated by scale 5 and the scale 1 indicated no connection.</div><div>Beck et al.
(2014; Brownell et al. (2012) and Malau-Aduli et al. (2012) have investigated
the benefit of inquiry based laboratories in biology curriculum in higher
education and their findings suggest that the students developed deeper
understanding in scientific content, increase confidence level in understanding
and improved students attitude towards science&nbsp;compared to traditional
laboratory teaching (13-15).</div><div>Bennett et al.
(2001) implemented authentic learning in two groups of student in multimedia
design in an advanced level subject with small project team and worked with a
real client to develop an interactive multimedia package (16). The students formed small project teams and worked with a real client to develop an interactive multimedia package. They found<b>&nbsp;</b>that this kind of learning program help student in problem solving,
critical thinking and judgement needed to work with complex multifaceted design
problems (17). S kinner and Cowan (1995) also investigated open-ended practical
learning method as part of their science education and have found that the
students developed good level of conceptual understanding and development of
process skill even for the poorest student (17). The authentic learning is therefore provides a means by which the students can link their theories and concept from the formal education to the workplace practice.</div><div>&nbsp;In the present paper, we have reported the
benefit of the implemented authentic laboratory education in the first year
undergraduate course at the University of Technology, Sydney, Australia.
We also have presented a design idea of an authentic learning observational
protocol for first year undergraduate laboratory program. In our laboratory education system we have introduced four different types of laboratory education such as traditional, theoretical type laboratory, semi-authentic and authentic experiment (project based experiment) to compare the benefit of the authentic learning over the other type of laboratory education system.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>Methodology:</b></div><div>Laboratory skills are vital part in Physics education. The
experience of the laboratory work deepens the understanding of the physical
concept and theories. It allows the students to develop the knowledge and
skills in designing, critical thinking, problem solving, data analysis, time
management and communications and finally beneficial use of science in real
world.&nbsp;</div><div>A mixed laboratory system with four different types of
laboratory education such as traditional physics practical, theoretical type of
laboratory experiment, semi-authentic and authentic (project based experiment
experiment) are introduced at the Physical Modelling first year undergraduate
laboratory program at the University of Technology Sydney. The aim of mixed
laboratory program is to identify the benefit of the authentic program over the
other system.</div><div></div><div>In a traditional
lab experiment the students normally gets the detail procedure of the
experiment or experimental guidebook including ideas of experimental set up,
data collection and graphing techniques. They are working in a small group of 2
or 3 students and complete their task in 2.5 hours. The lab demonstrator guided
the students in setting up and conducting the experiments. The students conduct
the experiment as outlined in the standard procedure, record the results in the
logbook, analyse and present it in informal way in the classroom. In this
traditional lab system, the students do not have to submit any formal report on
the experiment. The idea of the enquiry base experiment is to improve the
student’s ability to observe, manipulate equipment, interpret experimental data
or verify physics concept and finally increase their interest in the subject. .
In the traditional lab system there is no scope for the students in
self-directed inquiry, critical thinking, designing own experiment, problem
solving and connect their knowledge to the real word application.</div><div>In the
Theoretical Type of Lab Experiment, the students apply their theoretical ideas
or knowledge to predict the outcome of the experimental results then perform
the experiment according to the standard protocol and compare the results with
the prediction. This is similar to the traditional lab experiment except the
students have to predict the results by applying theories before doing the
experiment to integrate theory in practical application. Number of experiments
with different theoretical background was setup in the lab. Students formed a
small group and participate in group discussion to find out the solution of the
problem using their previous theoretical knowledge and also using internet
facility. The problems are given in the experimental guidebook.</div><div></div><div>The
authentic laboratory program (project experiment) offered in first year
undergraduate engineering course (Physical Modelling course) at the University
of Technology Sydney has been developed in consultation with industry “CHOICE”. CHOICE is a consumer advocate organisation here in Australia. “CHOICE” tested
consumer good for performance, safety and convenience with their testing
engineers. The industry has been taken on an observer role in the delivery of
the authentic laboratory program at UTS and its continuous evaluation.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In an authentic laboratory program, six project experiments are designed from different
field of Physics course. Students will work in small project team of 2-3
students in each and each team will work on up to six project experiments. No
instruction or procedure will be supplied to the students. However, a list of equipment
and possible important parameters related to the project experiment will be
available for students. Each project team members with discuss among themselves
and will bring a plan in each lab session. They will decide what measuring instrumentation
will be suitable for a specific project and which parameters are they going to
investigate. The project experiment is open-ended without any detail procedure.
The demonstrator will provide only a supportive role, promoting students
discussion and providing guidance rather than directing the activity. Each team
member will submit a ‘formal’ consultant report online in a concise form of
maximum 3 pages for each project work. In the report, they will include the
findings of the investigation and will provide the scientifically well-founded
recommendations to interested clients such as manufacturers, consumers and the
media. In the
authentic learning, the students get the opportunities to design their own
experiment through self-directed enquiry, critical thinking and developed an
idea and skills in problem solving, time and data management, professional
report writing and reflections in real world contexts.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div></div>
