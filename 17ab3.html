Authenticity with industry collaboration in mind.</b></div><div>The
the redesign of a the large first semester physics laboratory program for
engineering students into a sustainable, authentic learning environment that closely resembles a professional work place
in industry requires some steps that need to be considered carefully and
well in advance of the program implementation.</div><div></div><div>Our
starting point was an inquiry based laboratory program that followed
traditional laboratory teaching pedagogy with step-by-step experimental task
description and scaffolded, prescribed methods for collecting data and
presenting results. As often is the case in inquiry laboratory programs, the inquiry
component of experiments lies in connecting the steps of each task and finding
out how to handle or operate the bench dedicated equipment, i.e., experiments
can be conducted with little or no preparation before the lab class.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>There
are a number of high-level aspect to consider in the redesign process. The
redesign of any large undergraduate laboratory program irrespective of the
pedagogical aims can be a very time and resources consuming undertaking. Even
more so if a redesign goes beyond marginal changes to experiments or
replacement of experiments. Sustainability and further scalability is another
important factor to consider since resources need to be committed long term and
a new the program should not be easily compromised by fluctuations in student
numbers.</div><div></div><div>The
practice we followed in the past when making changes to our laboratory programs
was to introduce marginal changes to selected experimental setups (modernizing
equipment), making evidence based pedagogical adjustments to experimental
procedures (change from procedural to inquiry focus; identical experiment set) or
recycling suitable experiments from another laboratory program. Most of our
experiments evolved from classical, procedure driven experiments with a central
focus on verifying prominent aspects of a physics concept or exploring a
functional relationship between respective concept inherent parameters. The
experimental setups and equipment served the pedagogical goal and were not
suitable to be turned into a real work place simulating, authentic learning
experience. Further, academic and laboratory support staff are not experts in
workplace practices, common workplace infrastructure and workplace processes.</div><div></div><div>Since
the expectation was set for the new undergraduate laboratory program to become
an authentic learning experience that closely resembles a professional work place,
a suitable industry needed to be identified that can consult on workplace tasks
and experiment and laboratory processes. The redevelopment of an entire
laboratory program, including all experiments, requires substantial human and
financial resources. With resource constraints and sustainability well in mind,
and our limited expertise is in industry practices, it became evident that a
successful conversion to an authentic experimental laboratory program cannot be
achieved without industry closely engaged in the curriculum development,
participating to some degree in the delivery program and its evaluation, and having
some self interest in being motivated to be involved. This became the starting
point for the planning of our journey.</div><div></div><div>.1
The High-level Planning</div><div>The
higher level planning is concerned with general issues arising at the
interphase between university and industry, and what university and industry
may expect from each other.</div><div></div><div><i>Identify industry practise suitable for embedding authentic learning
experiences</i></div><div>Most academic environments at undergraduate
level use equipment and ask for task processes quite different from normal
industry practise. Even where experimental equipment is identical, the purpose
of the experiment in industry and the motivation to conduct the experimental
task may have little to do with the task focus in an undergraduate laboratory.
For an experiment and experimental task to be authentic, it needs to fit the
curriculum requirement and level of students’ disciplinary knowledge and
skills.</div><div></div><div><i>Identify suitable<u> </u>industry for course support</i></div><div>‘Industry’ is a wide carrying expression and
often industry from an academic perspective is a specific, idealised, almost stereotyped,
future working place of an ideal graduate. In addition, graduates usually find
employment in areas peripheral to their degree disciplinary core. Thus, a
potential industry partner needs to be vetted not only for vicinity to course
content but also for the suitability of their actual working practices for undergraduates
at first semester level.</div><div></div><div><i>Design of student engaged learning<u> </u>activities to support content
of laboratory work, course outcomes and graduate attributes.</i></div><div>Particular experiments and tasks carried out
in industry are usually not stand alone activities but a small contributing
step within a larger context of a goal to be achieved. This larger context is
essential to the authenticity of the lab task. It also has to contribute to
student experimental skill to be acquired as well as to expected learning outcomes.</div><div></div><div><i>Timeframe and Timetabling</i></div><div>The academic logistics surrounding the redesign of any laboratory
program usually follows a well-treated path, although by no means without the
equally usual bumps. In contrast, industry follows industry practices and unforgivingly
industry timelines. The industry partner under consideration should have the
capacity work along university timelines and, if industry staff is involved in
some teaching activities, some capacity to release staff for that purpose
should be available during the planning period as well as at required
university set teaching times.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>.2 Embedding Authenticity</div><div>&nbsp;<i>What disciplinary knowledge (concepts) are
students expected to learn?</i></div><div>The answer to this question is to a large extend prescribed by the degree
course content, in particular in the first semester which develops the
foundation knowledge for subsequent course. In the context with a collaboration
with industry though, the question arises is targeted industry is exposed to all,
some or only one first semester disciplinary concept. If authentic learning
experiences are to be embedded in an entire laboratory teaching program,
ideally work practices at the industry partner ought to cover all concepts
included in the lab program. Otherwise, multiple industry partners will be need
which adversely impact logistic alignment as well as long term sustainability
of the program.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><i>What practical skills are students expected
to learn?</i></div><div>Practical skills in undergraduate laboratory programs are the very reason
why these programs exist. Yet, the specific practical skills to be learned are
often not well articulated in the curriculum and rarely assessed in their
detail. It is more the outcome of the process of conducting an experiment that
is assessed rather than particular experimental skills. In that sense,
conducting an undergraduate experiment is then about learning about
experimental procedures with (in our case) physics concepts as contextualizing
backdrop. Processes and procedures in undergraduate experiments are generally
disjunct from actual practices in the workplace. Putting goggles, gloves and
lab coats on does not trick. (… some better phrase here)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><i>First semester skills used in industry in a
non-trivial way</i></div><div>By
their final year, closer to graduation, students have acquired advanced
disciplinary knowledge and skills and, hence, are in the position to conduct
more sophisticated experiments and have been trained to operate more
sophisticated, high-end equipment which may also be found in high-end industry. The question arises then, where in industry are (all
or some) the concepts taught and tested in experiments applied?</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>. 3 Suitable industry
partner</div><div>&nbsp;<i>Are industry partners under consideration
sufficiently resilient to maintain long-term collaboration?</i></div><div>Common aspects to consider
about the sustainability of a large first year university undergraduate laboratory
teaching program are whether required human and financial resources can be
maintained over the lifetime of the program and can adapt to student cohort fluctuating
of up to 20% without compromise, and whether physical lab resources can last and
respective consumable will be available over the period of the program. &nbsp;In a teaching program and teaching pedagogy
related interaction with industry, the desired period of continuous collaboration
with industry is likely be longer than in a disciplinary technology support or
technology development relation at graduate or professional academic research
level. Sustainability acquires secondary aspects then that are beyond the
control of the university. The industry partner should be large enough so that
the different cycles of operations between partners have little impact on
functional operation within their institution. Sufficient financial stability
and staff turnover rates are other factor to consider. Another factor to
consider is whether the unit, department or division size large enough or has a
long term capacity to support the relation with a non-core business entity on
non-revenue generating activities. &nbsp;Restructure
within the industry organization may put he undergraduate lab program at risk.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><i>What industries are suitable?</i></div><div>The disciplinary knowledge
and skills requirement in a first year physics (or any other) experimental
undergraduate program are very basic and far away from the knowledge and skills
that are applied in the discipline professional industry. Generally, the application basics science,
technology, engineering or maths skills can be found in almost all industry,
not just the one that universities deal with at the high-end. For our
objectives we ruled out Government run national research laboratories.
Although, in numbers, national research laboratories are the largest sector
industry that academia is collaboration with, only very small number of graduates
will their employment there. Government though comprises a number of policy
enforcing agencies such as environmental protection and law enforcement, and
service agencies in transport, hospital and work safety, all of which might
have an interest in early engagement with future graduates. Manufacturing is a
term that spreads across a large rage of sub-industries. Basic concepts of
physics are applied in many production stages in the automobile, construction, food,
textile, recycling and mining to name but a few. Other industries such service,
financial, legal don’t come readily to mind when it comes to first year
university physics and engineering, yet a large proportion of graduates may
find employment in these sectors. Further, applications of basic physics
concepts in those sectors rarely find their way into lecture and laboratory
teaching material. A collaborator in the service industry who might have a
mutual interest to be involved in a physics undergraduate lab program, e.g.,
could be a maintenance company (elevators, factory machines, bridges,
buildings); insurance evidence verification in financial industry; and large
patent offices in the legal industry. One is industry sector that is one of the
most heterogeneous and yet often not seen as being part of what academics think
of “industry” is the Not-for-Profit Organization (NPO) sector. This sector
engages in activities found in almost every area of industry. For instance, NPOs
engage in engineering support in developing countries, practical aspects of
environmental protection and consumer protection. It is the latter that in then
end our authentic laboratory program decided to partner with.</div><div></div><div></div><div><b>References:</b></div><div>1. Donovan, S., Bransford, J., and Pellegrino, (1999).
