Experiment (TExpt):</b></div><div>In a traditional lab experiment the
students normally gets the detail procedure of the experiment, ideas of
experimental set up, data collection and graphing techniques. The students
follow the standard procedure, collect the data and present it. The goal of the
traditional lab teaching is to possess a collection of large data according to
the prescribed procedure. In the tradition lab procedure there is no scope for
the students in self-directed inquiry, critical thinking, designing own
experiment, problem solving and connect their knowledge to the real word
application.</div><div>&nbsp;(Ref:
Sawyer, K. (2006). The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences. New York,
NY: Cambridge University Press).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>Theoretical
Type of Experiment (ThExpt):</b></div><div>In the Theoretical Type of Lab Experiment,
the students apply their theoretical ideas or knowledge to predict the outcome
of the experimental results then perform the experiment according to the
standard protocol and compare the results with the prediction. This is similar
to the traditional lab experiment except the students have to predict the
results by applying theories before doing the experiment. The students follow
the standard procedure given by the teacher before attending in the lab class.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>Semi-Authentic
Experiment (SAuExpt):</b></div><div>In a semi-authentic lab experiment the
students thought about the experiment before and they have been given some
ideas about the design or set up of the experiment but still it is open ended
without a script or standard procedure. The students will get an opportunity to
discuss within the group to find out a suitable way of data collection,
analysis, interpretation and presentation and therefore the students will
become an active learners and can serve beyond the classroom.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>Authentic
Experiment (AuExpt):</b></div><div>Authentic Learning is a pedagogical
approach that allows students to explore, discuss, design and meaningfully
construct a concepts that involve real world problems and projects that are
relevant to the learner. In the authentic learning, teacher provides
opportunities for students to design their own experiment through self-directed
enquiry, critical thinking, problem solving, time and data management and
reflections in real world contexts.</div><div>(Ref: Donovan, S., Bransford, J., and
